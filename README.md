# Employee Promotion Prediction Using IBM Watson Studio Machine Learning

**1. Introduction:**
**1.1 Overview:**

Promotion or career advancement is a process through which an employee of a company is given a higher share of duties, a higher pay scale, or both. Promotion is not just beneficial for employees but is also highly crucial for the employer or business owners.

enterprises become more and more fierce. Employees are the key
part of enterprises and significantly affect enterprises.
But what if you could have a reliable predictor for an employee that could predict if they would get promoted.
Then, you could have a secure and much fulfilling life.
